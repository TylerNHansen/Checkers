# High-level game control logic

# 1. Get a player1 and player2.
# 2. Get a board. Tell the board player1 is the current player.

# 3. Show the board to the current player.
# 4. Tell the current player to make a move

# 5. Check if the game is over. If it isn't, do 3 and 4 again.

# Move format is tentatively chosen as piece location + direction.
